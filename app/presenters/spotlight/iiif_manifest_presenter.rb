  # A presenter class that provides the methods that IIIFManifest expects, as well as convenience methods
  #  that will generate a IIIFManifest object, and the actual JSON manifest from the IIIFManifest object.
  #  Instances of this class represent IIIF leaf nodes.  We do not currently generate manifests with interstitial
  #  nodes.

  # IIIFManifest expects the following methods:  #file_set_presenters, #work_presenters, #manifest_url, #description.
