 # a mapping of configured Spotlight::ImageDerivatives
 # to their configured fields in the SolrDocument.
 # Any derivatives configured (descibed in Spotlight::ImageDerivatives)
 # will be available under #spotlight_image_versions and an array of available versions
 # (regardless of their is related data in the document) in the #spotlight_image_versions#versions array.
