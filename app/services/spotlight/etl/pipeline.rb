      # This ETL pipeline system, while somewhat generic, was implemented for Spotlight
      # to transform Spotlight::Resource instances into Solr documents. The resources
      # go through a series of steps (sources, transforms, loaders) to produce one or
      # more documents in the Solr index.
      #
      # All of the steps below can be provided as:
      #  - a lambda
      #  - a ruby class (which will be initialized for each pipeline execution)
      #  - or, a hash (of any length) with:
      #       - a key (used only for clarity in logging, particularly useful to label lambdas)
      #       - a value that is one of the valid step types (lambda or ruby class).
      #
      # Any of the transform or loader steps can `throw :skip` to skip the current source.
      #
      # Any exceptions raised by the pipeline's steps are sent to the context's
      # error handler by calling `#on_error` on the context object.

      # sources return enumerables that convert from the Spotlight::Etl::Context
      # to some data structure that the transform steps can handle. The Context is provided
      # by the implementation when the pipeline is executed.
      class_attribute :sources, default: []

      # The transform steps (pre-processes, transforms, and post-processes) receive
      # the current data state and the pipeline. The return value from the transforms
      # steps replaces the current data state, however the return values for pre- and
      # post- processing is ignored (although they may mutate the provided data, pipeline, etc).
      #
      # Through the pipeline argument, the transform steps can access:
      #  - `context`, the implementation-provided resource
      #  - `source`, the current source instance

      # additional processing.
