          <h2>Guidelines for CSV updates</h2>
          <p class="instructions">
            The downloadable CSV file for this exhibit contains one line for each item in the exhibit. Each line contains one or more comma-separated values. Although you can update the CSV file directly, we strongly recommended importing it into a spreadsheet application and making your updates there. The rest of these guidelines assume you are making updates in a spreadsheet.
          </p>
          <p class="instructions">
            Note that the more lines there are in the completed CSV file that you upload, the longer the updates will take to process. If your exhibit contains more than a few thousand items, after importing the CSV file into a spreadsheet application, you should consider removing the rows of items you do not intend to update. This will also make it easier to focus on the items you do intend to update.
          </p>
          <h3>Column headers</h3>
          <p class="instructions">
            Do not edit the column headers. These are used to match property values to existing exhibit item fields.
          </p>

          <h3>Reference fields</h3>
          <p class="instructions">
            Do not edit the reference fields. These are intended to help you identify items whose updatable fields you might want to change. Updates to the reference fields will not be processed.
          </p>

          <p class="instructions">
            If you are making a lot of updates, we recommended you use the protect or lock feature of your spreadsheet application to lock the reference field columns and ensure you don’t inadvertently edit them.
          </p>

          <h3>Updatable fields</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Visibility</dt>
            <dd>Valid values are <em>public</em> (expressed as <samp>TRUE</samp>) and <em>private</em> (blank value).</dd>

            <dt>Tags</dt>
            <dd>
              <p class="instructions">
                If you chose to include tags in the CSV file, there will be a column in the spreadsheet for each existing tag in the exhibit, prefixed with <samp>Tag:</samp>, such as <samp>Tag: apples</samp>. (If you want to add to items a tag that does not yet exist, you must first add that tag to at least one item (by editing an item or using the Bulk actions feature on a search result set of items) before downloading the CSV file.)
              </p>

              <p class="instructions">
                To assign a tag to an exhibit item, the value of the <samp>Tag:</samp> column for that item must be <samp>TRUE</samp>. A blank value in the <samp>Tag:</samp> column for an item means that tag is not assigned to that item.
              </p>

              <p class="instructions">
                To remove a tag currently assigned to an item, remove the <samp>TRUE</samp> value from the appropriate <samp>Tag:</samp> column for that item.
              </p>
            </dd>

        instructions_html: A CSV file listing each item in this exhibit will be generated with the reference and updatable fields you specify below. <i>Reference fields</i> are intended to help you identify items that you intend to update. <i>Updatable fields</i> are the fields for which you can update values (see guidelines below).

            <li>Download a CSV (comma-separated values) file from the Download CSV tab above. The downloaded CSV file will contain a row for every item in this exhibit. Each row contains the unique ID of an exhibit item along with the values of the reference and updatable fields you specify.</li>
            <li>Import the CSV file into a new spreadsheet, using an application such as a Google Sheets or Excel.</li>
            <li>In the new spreadsheet, update the values for the updatable fields of exhibit items you want to change. When you’ve finished making updates, save the spreadsheet.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Remove the rows for items that contain no updated values. This is not required but for exhibits with many items this can speed up the import process. If necessary, save the spreadsheet.</li>

        help_html: Before exhibit visitors can view translated pages you must create, edit, and publish each page translation. When you create a translated page, a copy of the default language version of the page is made to serve as the initial translated page. You can then edit that translated page to replace the page title and any text fields with translated text. A translated page will not be visible to exhibit visitors until you publish it.  To replace a translated page with a current copy of the default language version of the page, use the <b>Recreate</b> action.
