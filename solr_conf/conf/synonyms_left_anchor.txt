# Include in analysis with left anchor of 'aaaaaa'
#  for query or field beginning with token meant to be a synonym

# http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters#solr.SynonymFilterFactory
# A synonym file for Solr SynonymFilterFactory.
# Needs to be included at both index and query time 
#  AFTER the case folding
#  BEFORE the WordDelimiterFilterFactory that removes punctuation
# e.g. 
# <analyzer>
#   <!-- put beginning anchor on field value, assume first non-whitespace char is unicode letter or number or symbol -->
#   <charFilter class="solr.PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory" pattern="^\s*([\p{L}\p{N}\p{S}]{1})" replacement="aaaaaa$1"/>
#   <tokenizer class="solr.WhitespaceTokenizerFactory" />
#   <filter class="solr.ICUFoldingFilterFactory"/>  <!-- NFKC, case folding, diacritics removed -->
#   <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="synonyms.txt" ignoreCase="true" expand="false"/>
#   <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="synonyms_left_anchor.txt" ignoreCase="true" expand="false"/>
